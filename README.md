# CMPM120-Group18
Final Project for Group 18, CMPM 120, UCSC 2023 Spring Quarter

# Grading Notes:
We were marked off for not having fullscreen on mobile devices, but our fullscreen does work with mobile devices;
Correct me if I am wrong but as far as I am aware it is literally impossible to make a game fullcreen on iOS safari? 
Also, this new submission adds mobile controls, background music, and the music toggle button ( music toggle data saves between the title menu and credits scene).

## Theme
Our game utilizes the theme of "nearby in space, distant in time" through storytelling. The player is greeted on game-startup by a quick introduction to the plot: a futuristic skater has been sent to the past (our modern day) during a stunt. With only their hoverboard they are now stuck trying to make their way in the present.

- Our game transfers less than 1MB of data during gameplay.
2. Advanced Visual Asset
- Our game utilizes an MP4 file for the introduction cutscene.
